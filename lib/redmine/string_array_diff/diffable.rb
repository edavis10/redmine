  = Diff
  (({diff.rb})) - computes the differences between two arrays or
  strings. Copyright (C) 2001 Lars Christensen

  == Synopsis

      diff = Diff.new(a, b)
      b = a.patch(diff)

  == Class Diff
  === Class Methods
  --- Diff.new(a, b)
  --- a.diff(b)
        Creates a Diff object which represent the differences between
        ((|a|)) and ((|b|)). ((|a|)) and ((|b|)) can be either be arrays
        of any objects, strings, or object of any class that include
        module ((|Diffable|))

  == Module Diffable
  The module ((|Diffable|)) is intended to be included in any class for
  which differences are to be computed. Diffable is included into String
  and Array when (({diff.rb})) is (({require}))'d.

  Classes including Diffable should implement (({[]})) to get element at
  integer indices, (({<<})) to append elements to the object and
  (({ClassName#new})) should accept 0 arguments to create a new empty
  object.

  === Instance Methods
  --- Diffable#patch(diff)
        Applies the differences from ((|diff|)) to the object ((|obj|))
        and return the result. ((|obj|)) is not changed. ((|obj|)) and
        can be either an array or a string, but must match the object
        from which the ((|diff|)) was created.
