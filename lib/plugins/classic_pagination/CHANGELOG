* Exported the changelog of Pagination code for historical reference.

* Imported some patches from Rails Trac (others closed as "wontfix"):
  #8176, #7325, #7028, #4113. Documentation is much cleaner now and there
  are some new unobtrusive features!

* Extracted Pagination from Rails trunk (r6795)
