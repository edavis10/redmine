Pagination
==========

To install:

  script/plugin install svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/classic_pagination

This code was extracted from Rails trunk after the release 1.2.3.
WARNING: this code is dead. It is unmaintained, untested and full of cruft.

There is a much better pagination plugin called will_paginate.
Install it like this and glance through the README:

  script/plugin install svn://errtheblog.com/svn/plugins/will_paginate

It doesn't have the same API, but is in fact much nicer. You can
have both plugins installed until you change your controller/view code that
handles pagination. Then, simply uninstall classic_pagination.
