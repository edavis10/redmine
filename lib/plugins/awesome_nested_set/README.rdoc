= AwesomeNestedSet

Awesome Nested Set is an implementation of the nested set pattern for ActiveRecord models. It is replacement for acts_as_nested_set and BetterNestedSet, but more awesome.

Version 2 supports Rails 3. Gem versions prior to 2.0 support Rails 2.

== What makes this so awesome?

This is a new implementation of nested set based off of BetterNestedSet that fixes some bugs, removes tons of duplication, adds a few useful methods, and adds STI support.

== Installation

  Add to your Gemfile:

  gem 'awesome_nested_set'

== Usage

To make use of awesome_nested_set, your model needs to have 3 fields: lft, rgt, and parent_id:

  class CreateCategories < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :categories do |t|
        t.string :name
        t.integer :parent_id
        t.integer :lft
        t.integer :rgt
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :categories
    end
  end

Enable the nested set functionality by declaring acts_as_nested_set on your model

  class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set
  end

Run `rake rdoc` to generate the API docs and see CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet for more info.

== Protecting attributes from mass assignment

It's generally best to "white list" the attributes that can be used in mass assignment:

  class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set
    attr_accessible :name, :parent_id
  end

If for some reason that is not possible, you will probably want to protect the lft and rgt attributes:

  class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set
    attr_protected :lft, :rgt
  end

== Conversion from other trees

Coming from acts_as_tree or another system where you only have a parent_id? No problem. Simply add the lft & rgt fields as above, and then run

  Category.rebuild!

Your tree will be converted to a valid nested set. Awesome!

== View Helper

The view helper is called #nested_set_options.

Example usage:

  <%= f.select :parent_id, nested_set_options(Category, @category) {|i| "#{'-' * i.level} #{i.name}" } %>

  <%= select_tag 'parent_id', options_for_select(nested_set_options(Category) {|i| "#{'-' * i.level} #{i.name}" } ) %>

See CollectiveIdea::Acts::NestedSet::Helper for more information about the helpers.
