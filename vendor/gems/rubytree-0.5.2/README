Rubytree is a simple implementation of the generic Tree data structure.  This
implementation is node-centric, where the individual nodes on the tree are the
primary objects and drive the structure.

== INSTALL:

Rubytree is an open source project and is hosted at:

   http://rubytree.rubyforge.org

Rubytree can be downloaded as a Rubygem or as a tar/zip file from:

   http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=1215&release_id=8817

The file-name is one of:

    rubytree-<VERSION>.gem - The Rubygem
    rubytree-<VERSION>.tgz - GZipped source files
    rubytree-<VERSION>.zip - Zipped  source files

Download the appropriate file-type for your system.

It is recommended to install Rubytree as a Ruby Gem, as this is an easy way to
keep the version updated, and keep multiple versions of the library available on
your system.

=== Installing the Gem

To Install the Gem, from a Terminal/CLI command prompt, issue the command:

   gem install rubytree

This should install the gem file for Rubytree. Note that you may need to be a
super-user (root) to successfully install the gem.

=== Installing from the tgz/zip file

Extract the archive file (tgz or zip) and run the following command from the
top-level source directory:

    ruby ./setup.rb

You may need administrator/super-user privileges to complete the setup using
this method.

== DOCUMENTATION:

The primary class for this implementation is Tree::TreeNode. See the
class documentation for an usage example.

From a command line/terminal prompt, you can issue the following command to view
the text mode ri documentation:

    ri Tree::TreeNode

Documentation on the web is available at:

http://rubytree.rubyforge.org/rdoc

== EXAMPLE:

The following code-snippet implements this tree structure:

                 +------------+
                 |    ROOT    |
                 +-----+------+
         +-------------+------------+
         |                          |
 +-------+-------+          +-------+-------+
 |  CHILD 1      |          |  CHILD 2      |
 +-------+-------+          +---------------+
         |
         |
 +-------+-------+
 | GRANDCHILD 1  |
 +---------------+

 require 'tree'

 myTreeRoot = Tree::TreeNode.new("ROOT", "Root Content")

 myTreeRoot << Tree::TreeNode.new("CHILD1", "Child1 Content") << Tree::TreeNode.new("GRANDCHILD1", "GrandChild1 Content")

 myTreeRoot << Tree::TreeNode.new("CHILD2", "Child2 Content")

 myTreeRoot.printTree

 child1 = myTreeRoot["CHILD1"]

 grandChild1 = myTreeRoot["CHILD1"]["GRANDCHILD1"]

 siblingsOfChild1Array = child1.siblings

 immediateChildrenArray = myTreeRoot.children

 # Process all nodes

 myTreeRoot.each { |node| node.content.reverse }

 myTreeRoot.remove!(child1) # Remove the child
