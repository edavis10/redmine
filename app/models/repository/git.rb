  # With SCM's that have a sequential commit numbering, redmine is able to be
  # clever and only fetch changesets going forward from the most recent one
  # it knows about.  However, with git, you never know if people have merged
  # commits into the middle of the repository history, so we should parse
  # the entire log. Since it's way too slow for large repositories, we only
  # parse 1 week before the last known commit.
  # The repository can still be fully reloaded by calling #clear_changesets
  # before fetching changesets (eg. for offline resync)
