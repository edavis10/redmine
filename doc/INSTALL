Redmine - project management software
Copyright (C) 2006-2008  Jean-Philippe Lang

== Requirements

* Ruby on Rails 2.2.2
* A database:
  * MySQL (tested with MySQL 5)
  * PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 8.1)
  * SQLite (tested with SQLite 3)

Optional:
* SVN binaries >= 1.3 (needed for repository browsing, must be available in PATH)
* RMagick (gantt export to png)

== Installation

1. Uncompress the program archive
   
2. Create an empty database: "redmine" for example

3. Configure database parameters in config/database.yml
   for "production" environment (default database is MySQL)

4. Create the database structure. Under the application main directory:
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
   It will create tables and an administrator account.
   
5. Generate a session store secret
   Redmine stores session data in cookies by default, which requires
   a secret to be generated. Run:
   rake config/initializers/session_store.rb

6. Setting up permissions
   The user who runs Redmine must have write permission on the following
   subdirectories: files, log, tmp (create the last one if not present).

   Assuming you run Redmine with a user named redmine:
     mkdir tmp
     sudo chown -R redmine:redmine files log tmp
     sudo chmod -R 755 files log tmp

7. Test the installation by running WEBrick web server:
   ruby script/server -e production   
  
   Once WEBrick has started, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
   You should now see the application welcome page

8. Use default administrator account to log in:
   login: admin
   password: admin
   
   Go to "Administration" to load the default configuration data (roles, 
   trackers, statuses, workflow) and adjust application settings
