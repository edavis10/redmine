Redmine - project management software
Copyright (C) 2006-2010  Jean-Philippe Lang

== Requirements

* Ruby 1.8.6 or 1.8.7

* Ruby on Rails 2.3.5 (official downloadable Redmine releases are packaged with
  the appropriate Rails version)

* Rack 1.0.1

* RubyGems 1.3.1

* Rake 0.8.3

* A database:
  * MySQL (tested with MySQL 5)
  * PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 8.1)
  * SQLite (tested with SQLite 3)

Optional:
* SCM binaries (e.g. svn), for repository browsing (must be available in PATH)
* RMagick (to enable Gantt export to png images)
* Ruby OpenID Library >= version 2 (to enable OpenID support)

== Installation

1. Uncompress the program archive

2. Create an empty database: "redmine" for example

3. Configure the database parameters in config/database.yml
   for the "production" environment (default database is MySQL)

4. Generate a session store secret
   
   Redmine stores session data in cookies by default, which requires
   a secret to be generated. Under the application main directory run:
     rake generate_session_store

5. Create the database structure
   
   Under the application main directory run:
     rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"
   
   It will create all the tables and an administrator account.

6. Setting up permissions (Windows users have to skip this section)
   
   The user who runs Redmine must have write permission on the following
   subdirectories: files, log, tmp & public/plugin_assets (create the last
   two if they are not yet present).
   
   Assuming you run Redmine with a user named "redmine":
     mkdir tmp public/plugin_assets
     sudo chown -R redmine:redmine files log tmp public/plugin_assets
     sudo chmod -R 755 files log tmp public/plugin_assets

7. Test the installation by running the WEBrick web server
   
   Under the main application directory run:
     ruby script/server -e production
   
   Once WEBrick has started, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
   You should now see the application welcome page.

8. Use the default administrator account to log in:
   login: admin
   password: admin
   
   Go to "Administration" to load the default configuration data (roles,
   trackers, statuses, workflow) and to adjust the application settings

== SMTP server Configuration

Copy config/email.yml.example to config/email.yml and edit this file
to adjust your SMTP settings.
Do not forget to restart the application after any change to this file.

Please do not enter your SMTP settings in environment.rb.
