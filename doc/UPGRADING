== Upgrading

1. Uncompress the program archive in a new directory
   
2. Copy your database settings (RAILS_ROOT/config/database.yml)
   and SMTP settings (RAILS_ROOT/config/email.yml)
   into the new config directory
   DO NOT REPLACE OR EDIT ANY OTHER FILES.

3. Generate a session store secret
   Redmine stores session data in cookies by default, which requires
   a secret to be generated. Run:
   rake generate_session_store
      
4. Migrate your database (please make a backup before doing this):
   rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"

5. Copy the RAILS_ROOT/files directory content into your new installation
   This directory contains all the attached files

== Notes

1. Rails 2.3.5 is required for version 0.9.

2. When upgrading your code with svn update, don't forget to clear
   the application cache (RAILS_ROOT/tmp/cache) before restarting.
